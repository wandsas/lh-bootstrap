#
# This is the top Makefile for lh-bootstrap
# It is invoked by running "./make" after editing lh-config
#
# Each target, for instance "$(OUTPUT)/tmp/.lh_installed",
# is a witness file, ie the file is not needed anywhere but is
# used by make to handle dependencies. Each of these files is
# being touched at the end of each recipe to update its date,
# since make relies on dates to handle updates of targets.
#
# * why these "exec" at the beginning at each line?
# => make spawns a shell for every line in every recipe.
# The "exec" keyword at the beginning of the recipe lines
# is just a small optimization: it ensures that the shell
# doesn't stay around while the recipe line is running,
# so it saves a little RAM and CPU. On most build machines,
# this should not be noticeable.
#
# * why these "setuidgid $(NORMALUSER)" ?
# => to drop privileges, from root to a normal user, for recipes
# that do not need root privileges. The user's name is defined in
# lh-config.
#
# * why do we need to be root?
# => Because some unavoidable operations in the build process need root privileges:
#     + correctly handling several different uids for the target.
#     + manipulating and deleting a loopback device, to create the disk images.
#
# * why is skarnet.org often an order-only prerequisite in the sub-Makefiles?
# => When it's the case, it means the build process, not the target,
# depends on a skarnet.org tool (for instance s6-touch) built for the
# BUILD machine. There's no need to rebuild everything if the tool
# changes, since the HOST image does not depend on its details; we
# just need to ensure that the tool is there.
